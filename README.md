# CyberDSA-SIBERSIAGA-2024
On 6 - 8 August 2024, RE:HACK was invited to join Nanosec's Community lounge during CyberDSA+SIBERSIAGA to promote Malaysia Cybersecurity Camp and we utilised the opportunity given to let the alumni share their research with the public. The experience was phenomenal!

Naqib, who came impromptu, stepped up and shared his interesting hobbies about lockpicking, card cloning and others. 

Fira also did her best in promoting MCC and showed her sales expertise in selling our merchandise so we could have some additional funds to cover the activities we will run in the future.

Not to forget, Roheender who attracted many people with his knowledge in Web3 security on the final day of the event. Roheender wrote about this in his medium post here https://medium.com/@MaanVader/introduction-to-web3-and-smart-contract-security-understanding-the-basics-and-common-6bb84442f6fe. Also, he would like to share the challenges and presentation slides he shared during the event which you could get them in this repo!
